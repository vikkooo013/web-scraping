# web-scraping

the python script here scrapes linkedin for candiate details and saves them in a csv file,
though there are bugs in the script it achieves basic functionality and with a few modifications will work fine, i'll try and improve on the output of the script.
please use Firefox webdriver also know as 'geckodriver for using the script,cheers.
